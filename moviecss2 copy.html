        <h1>Ladybird</h1>
        <p>Strong-willed, introspective, but sometimes oblivious. Lady Bird pays great attention to her surroundings, but sometimes her focus makes her ignore the bigger picture. She's feisty, and her heart is in the right place, usually, but even the purest of people can fall sway to the havoc-wreaking traps of senior year.</p>
